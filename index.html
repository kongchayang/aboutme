                <p>Thru out her life, most men have never treated Brienne well. She was considered undesirable, and very unladylike. When Renly visited Tarth on his leisurely lordâ€™s progress, to mark his coming of age. Her father held a feast for Renly, and a fourteen year old Brienne was order to attain, or she would've of hide in her room. Brienne was never afraid of a fight, but people mocking her, that another thing.  During the feast, her fear started to become a reality, until Renly ask her to dance. She was somehow graceful under his arm, and he made her feel like she was floating across the dance floor. The teasing and snickering of Brienne stop after that. </p>
